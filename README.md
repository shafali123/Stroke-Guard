## StrokeGuard
The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that stroke is the second greatest cause of mortality worldwide and a major contributor to disability.Strokes claim the lives of about 5.5 million people annually, and survivors frequently suffer from long-term impairments that lower their quality of life. However, stroke can be avoided, and prompt action can have a big impact. 

Therefore, based on several physiological characteristics, I have developed a stroke prediction model that employs five different machine learning algorithms to determine the likelihood that a person would experience a brain stroke.

## Introduction

The StrokeGuard project is designed predict the probability of a person suffering from stroke based on their physiological attributes.

The machine learning algorithms which were employed in this project are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest.  

This project is built using the Flask framework, which allows for easy deployment and interaction with the physiological attributes through a web interface. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

The StrokeGuard project incorporates the following technologies:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- And more...


## Usage

The main code for the Jupyter notebook can be found at `Stroke-final.ipynb`

1. Open the StrokeGuard web application in your preferred web browser.

2. Fill the physiologial attibutes which are asked for prediction

3. Click the "Submit" button.

4. Wait for the machine learning algorithms to process the input and predict whether you have the probability of getting a stroke.

5. Whether you are likely or not to get a brain stroke is predicted.
